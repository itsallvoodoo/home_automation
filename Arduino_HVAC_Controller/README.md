The purpose of this file is to control a 5 wire HVAC system with an Arduino Uno, a DFRobot Relay Shield v2.1, and a Dallas DS1820 Temperature Sensor. The code is provided as an example of how you can use the previously listed components to control HVAC and may not work with your system. Use the code as a guide only on how you can write similar code. Equipment damage and personal injury can result with the use of this code. You have been warned.

Included files:
HVAC_Controller.ino - This is the Arduino sketch that must be uploaded to your Arduino Uno in order to control the rest of the hardware. It must reside in a folder called HVAC_Controller in order to be recognized by the Arduino IDE. Inside of HVAC_Controller.ino are several libraries which must be inside your sketches\libraries folder in order to compile the program.
