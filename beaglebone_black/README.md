Beaglebone Black Home Automation System

The files in this directory are a collection of all the components that are needed or I have created in
order to implement various home automation tasks. There is several features I wish to implement:

1. HVAC Control
2. Security System Monitoring
3. RFID Access Control

The features are meant to be configureable via the website. As soon as that is completed, I will move to
making an Android app that will have the same functionality.
